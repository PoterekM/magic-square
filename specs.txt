What we need

The program generates a 3 x 3 square.

The program will give a single starting number in its correct position.

The program allows the user to enter numbers into the boxes in the square.

The individual boxes should know whether they're empty or full.

The program will determine if a user-inputted number is correct or not.

The program will clear the box and give an indicator if the inputted number is wrong.

The program will alert the user when they've solved the square correctly.



What we want

The program will indicate a right answer by outlining the box in green and a wrong answer by outlining the box in red.

Once the user has solved a square, the program will generate a square of increasing complexity (e.g. a 5 x 5 after a 3 x 3).



Things on our wishlist

The program sets a timer and times the user when they start playing.

The program returns to the user how long it took them to complete the square.

The program tallies the number of wrong answers.

The program generates the solution via a programmed algorithm rather than it being hard-coded.
